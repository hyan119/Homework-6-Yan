## Tree-Based Models

For this assignment, we will continue working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

**Note: Fitting ensemble tree-based models can take a little while to run. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit.**

### Exercise 1

Read in the data and set things up as in Homework 5:

- Use `clean_names()`
- Filter out the rarer Pokémon types
- Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors

Do an initial split of the data; you can choose the percentage for splitting. Stratify on the outcome variable.

Fold the training set using *v*-fold cross-validation, with `v = 5`. Stratify on the outcome variable.

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`:

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;
- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
pokemon = read.csv("data/Pokemon.csv")
pokemon = pokemon %>% 
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(type_1 %in% c('Bug', 'Fire', 'Grass', 'Normal', 'Water', 'Psychic')) %>%
  mutate(type_1 = factor(type_1), legendary = factor(legendary))

pokemon_split = initial_split(pokemon, prop = 0.7, strata = type_1)
pokemon_train = training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_test = testing(pokemon_split)

pokemon_fold = vfold_cv(data = pokemon_train, v = 5, strata = type_1)

pokemon_recipe = recipe(data = pokemon_train,formula = type_1 ~ legendary+generation+sp_atk+attack+speed+defense+hp+sp_def) %>%
  step_dummy(c(legendary,generation)) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())
```
### Exercise 2

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the continuous variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*

What relationships, if any, do you notice? Do these relationships make sense to you?

```{r}
pokemon_train %>%
  select(is.numeric, -generation, -x, -total) %>%
  cor(use = "complete.obs") %>%
  corrplot(type = "lower", diag = FALSE)
```
We remove Generation, and x(the ID) from the matrix because they do not directly contribute to the stats of pokemons. We remove total from the matrix because it depends on all the other numeric variables that are not removed(sum of them).

sp_def has positive correlation with defense and hp, which makes sense because They are all defensive status. Sp_attack has positive correlation with attack and speed, which makes sense because they are all offensive status. sp_atk has positive correlation with sp_defense, and speed has positive correlation with attack, which makes sense because they are both sp_ status. 

However, attack and hp, attack and defense sharing positive correlation did not make sense for me, unless stronger Pokemon have better overall status without specialty.


### Exercise 3

First, set up a decision tree model and workflow. Tune the `cost_complexity` hyperparameter. Use the same levels we used in Lab 7 -- that is, `range = c(-3, -1)`. Specify that the metric we want to optimize is `roc_auc`. 

Print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? Does a single decision tree perform better with a smaller or larger complexity penalty?

```{r}
tree_spec = decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart")

class_tree_spec = tree_spec %>%
  set_mode("classification")

class_tree_fit = class_tree_spec %>%
  fit(type_1 ~ legendary+generation+sp_atk+attack+speed+defense+hp+sp_def, data = pokemon_train)

class_tree_wf = workflow() %>%
  add_model(class_tree_spec %>% set_args(cost_complexity = tune())) %>%
  add_formula(type_1 ~ legendary+generation+sp_atk+attack+speed+defense+hp+sp_def)

param_grid = grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 8)

tune_res = tune_grid(
  class_tree_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_fold, 
  grid = param_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)

autoplot(tune_res)
```
the roc_auc value stayed consistent when the compexity panalty value increased for a short range, then it starts to decline massively and drops to 0.5 at 0.1 cost complexity. A single decision tree model performs better with smaller complexity panelty. 

### Exercise 4

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*
```{r}
tune_res %>%
  collect_metrics() %>% 
  arrange(by_group = desc(mean))
pred = augment(class_tree_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>% 
  select(type_1, starts_with(".pred"))
pred %>% roc_auc(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water)
```
The `roc_auc` value of my best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds is 0.6320870	

### Exercise 5

Using `rpart.plot`, fit and visualize your best-performing pruned decision tree with the *training* set.

```{r}
best_complexity = select_best(tune_res)

class_tree_final = finalize_workflow(class_tree_wf, best_complexity)

class_tree_final_fit = fit(class_tree_final, data = pokemon_train)

class_tree_final_fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()
```
### Exercise 5

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`. Tune `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why not. What type of model would `mtry = 8` represent?**

```{r}
bagging_spec = rand_forest() %>%
  set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

bagging_fit = fit(bagging_spec, type_1 ~ legendary+generation+sp_atk+attack+speed+defense+hp+sp_def, data = pokemon_train)

bagging_wf = workflow() %>%
  add_model(bagging_spec %>% set_args(mtry = tune(), trees = tune(), min_n = tune())) %>%
  add_formula(type_1 ~ legendary+generation+sp_atk+attack+speed+defense+hp+sp_def)

regular_grid = grid_regular(mtry(range = c(1,8)), trees(range = c(1,2000)), min_n(range = c(1,100)), levels = 8)

```
`mtry`:  amount of predictors to be selected randomly for each tree

`trees`:  number of trees in the ensemble

`min_n`:  minimum points in a node in order to split further

mtry cannot be smaller than 1 since you need at least one predictor in your model; it cannot exceed 8 since there are 8 predictors in total. mtry = 8 means we include all the predictors.  

### Exercise 6

Specify `roc_auc` as a metric. Tune the model and print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? What values of the hyperparameters seem to yield the best performance?  

```{r}
tune_regular = tune_grid(
  bagging_wf,
  resamples = pokemon_fold,
  grid = regular_grid,
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)
autoplot(tune_regular)
```

### Exercise 7

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing random forest model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*  

```{r}
tune_regular %>% 
  collect_metrics() %>%
  arrange(by_group = desc(mean))
pred2 = augment(bagging_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>% 
  select(type_1, starts_with(".pred"))
pred2 %>% roc_auc(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water)
```

### Exercise 8

Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`, with your best-performing random forest model fit on the *training* set.

Which variables were most useful? Which were least useful? Are these results what you expected, or not?  
```{r}
bagging_fit %>% 
  extract_fit_engine() %>% 
  vip()
```

### Exercise 9

Finally, set up a boosted tree model and workflow. Use the `xgboost` engine. Tune `trees`. Create a regular grid with 10 levels; let `trees` range from 10 to 2000. Specify `roc_auc` and again print an `autoplot()` of the results. 

What do you observe?

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing boosted tree model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*
```{r}
boost_spec = boost_tree(tree_depth = 4) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

boost_fit = fit(boost_spec, type_1 ~ legendary+generation+sp_atk+attack+speed+defense+hp+sp_def, data = pokemon_train)

boost_wf = workflow() %>%
  add_model(boost_spec %>% set_args(trees = tune())) %>%
  add_formula(type_1 ~ legendary+generation+sp_atk+attack+speed+defense+hp+sp_def)

boost_grid = grid_regular(trees(range = c(10,2000)), levels = 10)

tune_boosted = tune_grid(
  boost_wf,
  resamples = pokemon_fold,
  grid = boost_grid,
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)
```

```{r}
autoplot(tune_boosted)
tune_boosted %>% 
  collect_metrics() %>%
  arrange(by_group = desc(mean))
pred3 = augment(boost_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>% 
  select(type_1, starts_with(".pred"))
pred3 %>% roc_auc(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water)
```

### Exercise 10

Display a table of the three ROC AUC values for your best-performing pruned tree, random forest, and boosted tree models. Which performed best on the folds? Select the best of the three and use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `fit()` to fit it to the *testing* set. 

Print the AUC value of your best-performing model on the testing set. Print the ROC curves. Finally, create and visualize a confusion matrix heat map.

Which classes was your model most accurate at predicting? Which was it worst at?  

```{r}
best_prune = pred %>% roc_auc(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water)
best_forest = pred2 %>% roc_auc(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water)
best_boosted = pred3 %>% roc_auc(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water)
tibble( data.frame(best_prune[3],best_forest[3],best_boosted[3]))
```

```{r}
best_model <- select_best(tune_regular)

tree_forest_final <- finalize_workflow(bagging_wf, best_model)

tree_forest_final_fit <- fit(tree_forest_final, data = pokemon_train)
```


The random forest performed best on the folds.
```{r}
pred4 = augment(tree_forest_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>% 
  select(type_1, starts_with(".pred"))
pred4 %>% roc_auc(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water)
pred4 %>% roc_curve(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water) %>% 
 autoplot()
pred4 %>% 
 conf_mat(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
 autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```
The model is accurate in predicting every pokemon class. The only class with a wrong prediction is Grass.

### Exercise 11

Using the `abalone.txt` data from previous assignments, fit and tune a random forest model to predict `age`. Use stratified cross-validation and select ranges for `mtry`, `min_n`, and `trees`. Present your results. What was the model's RMSE on your testing set?
